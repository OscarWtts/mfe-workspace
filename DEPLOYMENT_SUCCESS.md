## 🎯 Mission Accomplished!

The micro-frontend architecture has been successfully deployed to Google Kubernetes Engine with a robust CI/CD pipeline. The system is now production-ready with:

- **Automated builds** triggered by version tags
- **Reliable deployments** to Kubernetes
- **Health monitoring** and endpoint testing
- **Scalable infrastructure** on GKE
- **Clear documentation** and operational guides

Both applications are live and accessible at their respective URLs. The deployment pipeline ensures that future updates can be released safely through the established tag-based workflow.
